# Description
This Individual Project was submitted for my graded exam in a python course highlighting my understanding as a software developer in implementing basic computer algorithms in games.

This Tic tac toe can be played against friend, but also allows player to challenge the CPU, offering two levels of difficulty.
In Easy mode, the CPU selects random available space for its move. 
In Medium mode, the CPU can strategically block the user's move if the user is close to winning.

While the current condition is fully functional, I plan to enhance it by adding a Hard mode algorithm in the future, enabling the CPU to evaluate all possible user moves for a more challenging experience.

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul><li>"User vs User" and "User vs CPU" game modes</li>
<li>CPU with Easy and Medium difficulty levels</li>
</ul>
